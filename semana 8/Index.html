<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
Ferdinand Porsche founded the company called "Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH" in 1931,with main offices at Kronenstraße 24 in the centre of Stuttgart. Initially, the company offered motor vehicle development work and consulting,but did not build any cars under its own name. One of the first assignments the new company received was from the German government to design a car for the people, that is a "Volkswagen".This resulted in the Volkswagen Beetle, one of the most successful car designs of all time.The Porsche 64 was developed in 1939 using many components from the Beetle.</p>

<h1>New Porsche Carrera Gt</h1>

Pure. Energy.

Some stories are told in just 6 minutes and 57 seconds. For this story, that is only the beginning. It starts with a hybrid – but one that had to be distinctively Porsche. And with intelligent technology. Our challenge is to move forward with confidence and take a new direction.

What do we need to achieve this? GT drivers. Carrera Gt pioneers. To provide the initial spark and to reignite the old sports car dream. The Carrera Gt represents an entirely new look at the supercar. It heralds the future of the sports car and you can be there at the start.
